# Code Review Feedback

## General Remarks

Great job on tackling these problems! Your solutions demonstrate a solid understanding of fundamental programming concepts and a good effort in approaching each problem. Here are a few suggestions and areas for improvement:

### Q1

**Passed**  
Well done on this question!

### Q2

**Areas for Improvement:**
- **Special Cases Handling**: You need to handle division by zero exceptions. This applies to both small fractions (e.g., `b/c`) and the whole equation (`e/(f+g)`).

### Q3

**Leap Year Calculation:**
- Ensure your code checks all criteria for determining a leap year as stated in the problem description.

### Q4

**Factorial Calculation:**
- Factorials are not defined for negative numbers or floats. Your program currently accepts floats and converts them to integers, which might confuse users into thinking that floats have factorials.

### Q5

**Trigonometric Functions:**
- **Input Format**: The input should be in degrees as stated in the problem description.
- **Sin Function Implementation**: You've done well using the pattern, but if the angle exceeds \(2\pi\) (e.g., \(3\pi\)), it should be reduced using the modulo operator. Consider the following adjustment:
  ```python
  term = ((-1)**i) * ((angle**(2*i+1)) % (2 * math.pi)) / math.factorial(2*i+1)
  ```

### Circular Shift Problem

- If the list is empty, it's better to throw an exception and print a message indicating that the array is empty, even though your current code works without errors.

### Transpose Problem

- Consider defining a function to handle input operations for better readability. This will help you manage more complex problems by reducing the number of lines in the main section.

### Merge Problem

- You've successfully merged two arrays, but the resultant array isn't sorted. Consider the following revised implementation:
  ```python
  def merge_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2):
      merged_array = []
      i, j = 0, 0

      while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):
          if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
              merged_array.append(arr1[i])
              i += 1
          else:
              merged_array.append(arr2[j])
              j += 1

      while i < len(arr1):
          merged_array.append(arr1[i])
          i += 1

      while j < len(arr2):
          merged_array.append(arr2[j])
          j += 1

      return merged_array
  ```

### Max Row Problem

- **Recursion Issue**: Calling the function recursively in case of invalid data can lead to callback hell and excessive memory consumption. Use a while loop in the main section and catch exceptions to inform the user of invalid data.
- **Finding the Max Row**: Great job on identifying the max row! Consider the following improved approach:
  ```python
  def func():
      while True:
          try:
              rows = int(input("Enter rows (1 < rows <= 20): "))
              columns = int(input("Enter columns (1 < columns <= 20): "))
              if rows <= 1 or rows > 20 or columns <= 1 or columns > 20:
                  raise ValueError("Invalid numbers")
              break
          except ValueError as e:
              print(e)
      
      two_dim_array = []
      max_value = 0
      for i in range(rows):
          row = []
          temp_value = 0
          for j in range(columns):
              value = int(input(f"Enter the value for element ({i},{j}): "))
              row.append(value)
              temp_value += value
          if temp_value > max_value:
              max_value = temp_value
          two_dim_array.append(row)
      
      max_row = [sum(row) for row in two_dim_array].index(max_value)
      print(f"The row with the maximum sum is: {max_row} with a sum of {max_value}")
      two_dim_array[0], two_dim_array[max_row] = two_dim_array[max_row], two_dim_array[0]
      for row in two_dim_array:
          print(row)
  func()
  ```

### Matrix Multiplication Problem

- **Error Handling**: Raise errors for negative values and dimension mismatches before getting the content of the matrix. For example, if the first matrix is 3x3, the second matrix should be 3xN where N is any integer.
- **Code Structure**: Well done on dividing the code into functions!

### Sum of Digits Function

- You don't need to pass the sum variable since it is always zero at the beginning. Define a local variable within the function with an initial value of 0.

### Digital Multiplication of Two Big Integers

- Good job! To improve, avoid duplicating the code for x and y verification. Create a function for verification and call it twice. Also, avoid recursive calls within this function.

Keep up the great work! You've made significant progress, and with these improvements, your solutions will be even stronger. Happy coding!
